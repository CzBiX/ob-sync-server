# ob-sync-server
A reimplemented sync server for Obsidian via reverse engineering.

Some behavior may be different from the official server.

## What works
- [x] user login
- [x] vault listing, creation, and deletion
- [x] document live syncing
- [x] document history, restore

## TODO
- [ ] usage instructions
- [ ] database/storage cleaning
- [ ] API to access vaults/documents
- [ ] share vault
- [ ] publish maybe?
